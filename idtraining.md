[ ] that's just a selection of tools we could use
[ ] tonight we will be using iD editor - iD uses a Javascript library called D3
[ ] select `iD`
[ ] woah what happened?? now we've moved to open street map
[ ] we'll work with iD directly in Open Street Map - the changes you save will be LIVE straight away in OSM
[ ] this is why we have a validating room next door - we hope to help people improve
[ ] Ralph who often teaches the more advanced mappers how to validate will be sharing some tips later
